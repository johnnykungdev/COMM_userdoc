## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to offer users a basic understanding of prototyping using Figma. Figma is a web-based graphic design editor created by Figma. inc in 2016. It is available on Windows/Mac desktop app and IOS/Android mobile app versions, which contain additional offline features. Figma is packed with multiple design features such as the Arc tool and Vector Networks, and it also allows designers to collaborate online. With versatile functions, Figma allows users to create a scalable design system that is easy to manage. 

In this documentation, we will be using the web version of Figma with a free starter plan. Once you sign up with an email account, you'll get access to up to 3 projects and be able to collaborate with another editor online.

## Intended users

This document is intended for novice designers who have no previous knowledge of using Figma. The user should be able to create web app prototypes and collaborate with other designers and/or developers. 

## Prerequisites

- Computer with any operation system
- Any of the web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc.)
- An email account to sign up with free starter plan

## Create a Project

Creating projects allow a user to group your related design files together in a single area, like a folder in a file system. Projects are only available in teams. Create teams for your own work, or for collaborating within a group. In a Starter Team, you can create up to 2 Projects.

Create a new team project from the team workspace

1. Click on the New project button in the top right-hand corner of the screen in the team workspace

Create a new project from the left side bar

1. Hover over the team name
2. Click on the plus icon(screenshot) to create a new project within the team
3. In the create new project modal give your new project a meaningful name. It is possible to rename the project at any time
4. Teams can set different permissions for a project: 
    - **Edit**: the default project permissions
    - **View**: even if team members have edit permissions on they can only view the project when in this permission
    - I**nvite-only**: only team members or collaborators you invite to the project will be able to access files in this project

5. Click **Create project** to create the new project
6. The project page will open in the file browser

## Invite Designers to Collaborate

After creating a project you can invite others as collaborators. Members can add a collaborator at a permission level equal to, or less than, their own permissions. Team members can be added as either an editor or a viewer.

- **Editors** can invite others to the team as Viewers or Editors.
- **Viewers** can only invite other Viewers to the team.

### Invite as a viewer:

Any member can invite another viewer to the project but a viewer member cannot invite an editor to the project. The viewers in a project can only view and comment on files and projects. 

1. Choose a team project to invite someone to in the sidebar and go to the Members tab.

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e86302d7-1d76-47bb-8ef3-4f331b55fa8e/Screen_Shot_2021-04-07_at_10.51.06_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e86302d7-1d76-47bb-8ef3-4f331b55fa8e/Screen_Shot_2021-04-07_at_10.51.06_AM.png)

2. Click on the Invite button in the top-right corner.
3. A pop-up will appear for the email for the new member. There will be an option between can view or can edit. Click on the drop-down menu and choose can view. Figma will send the invite to the email. 

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2f5c4ad1-59c0-473a-93e3-0d205605461b/Screen_Shot_2021-04-07_at_11.04.25_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2f5c4ad1-59c0-473a-93e3-0d205605461b/Screen_Shot_2021-04-07_at_11.04.25_AM.png)

### Invite as a editor:

Only members with a can edit access can invite editors to the team. 

Note: Team members will need to accept an edit invitation before they can get edit access to the team. They can accept the invitation from the email or from their notifications in Figma. This is a similar process to inviting a viewer member

1. Choose a team project to invite someone to in the sidebar and go to the Members tab.
2. Click on the Invite button in the top-right corner.

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e86302d7-1d76-47bb-8ef3-4f331b55fa8e/Screen_Shot_2021-04-07_at_10.51.06_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e86302d7-1d76-47bb-8ef3-4f331b55fa8e/Screen_Shot_2021-04-07_at_10.51.06_AM.png)

3. A pop-up will appear for the email for the new member. There will be an option between can view or can edit. Click on the drop-down menu and choose can edit. Figma will send the invite to the email.

## Task 1. Build App Pages with Layer

Layers are any frames, groups or objects created in the canvas area. They will be shown in the layer panel on the left of the page. Layers' kinds are indicated with different icons. The list of layers are as following: 

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cab14fe2-95d1-4906-9a39-426a21810a37/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cab14fe2-95d1-4906-9a39-426a21810a37/Untitled.png)

The "Frame" layer will be used to create pages in Figma. 

1. open the layer panel on the left of the page

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7f00ef74-17a7-4c0c-9485-715f4e44ec2b/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7f00ef74-17a7-4c0c-9485-715f4e44ec2b/Untitled.png)

2. [Click] on the "Region tools". There will be two options: "Frames" and "slice"

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ade9e663-7234-4748-b8a3-34924696cc86/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ade9e663-7234-4748-b8a3-34924696cc86/Untitled.png)

3. After [clicking] the "frame", the region tool will be blue. Make sure it's select.

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/232ba061-6687-450e-bda5-4c53f64815dc/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/232ba061-6687-450e-bda5-4c53f64815dc/Untitled.png)

4. To create a page-like layer, [Click] "Frame". Then [Move] the mouse to the grey part of the Figma, which is drawing area. [Click] on the starting point, then keep [Dragging] until the frame matches the expected size and shape.

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/78c73506-0388-4335-b7c0-2f4f641f7a1c/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/78c73506-0388-4335-b7c0-2f4f641f7a1c/Untitled.png)

5. Upon successful creation, click either ["Frame 1"] on the layer panel or the frame in the canvas area to see its properties. The properties are shown in the property panel on the right side of the page. Height, width and other properties can be adjust in the property panel.
